details:

We import the PyPDF2 library, which provides functionality to work with PDF files in Python.

We define a function called read_pdf that takes a file_path parameter. This function will read the PDF file and extract its text content.

Within the read_pdf function, we open the PDF file in binary mode using the provided file_path.

We create a PdfReader object from the opened file, which allows us to read and interact with the PDF document.

We determine the number of pages in the PDF by getting the length of the pages attribute of the PdfReader object.

We initialize an empty string variable called text to store the extracted text from the PDF.

Using a loop, we iterate over each page of the PDF.

For each page, we extract the text content using the extract_text() method of the PageObject class.

We append the extracted text to the text variable.

After processing all the pages, we return the accumulated text.

In the usage example section, you should replace "path/to/your/pdf_file.pdf" with the actual file path of the PDF you want to read.

We try to read the PDF by calling the read_pdf function with the specified file_path. If successful, we print the extracted text content. If any exception occurs, we print an error message indicating the failure.

Note that PyPDF2 may have limitations with certain PDF features or complex file structures. If you encounter any issues, you may need to explore alternative libraries like PyMuPDF or PDFMiner.six for more robust PDF parsing capabilities.
